## About Project

This project is a matlab code for the homogenization of 2D and 3D truss cells. 

## Getting started

Add the 'fun' and 'src' folder to the MATLAB search path. Two folders contains all the functions that implement the functionality. Then, try running CH2D.m, CH3D.m, CHTran3D.m, and AssembledModel3D.m files.

## Note

The 'src' folder mainly contains the visualization module of homogenizated properties. This module comes from: Mingqing Liao, Yong Liu, Nan Qu e.t. al.
